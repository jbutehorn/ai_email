# ai_email
Tools to generate email content for brands.

Steps to using tool:

1. Create an Open AI API Key -> run 'export OPENAI_KEY=<Your API Key>'
2. Create a Klaviyo Account -> run 'export KLAVIYO_KEY=<Your Klaviyo API Key>'
3. Install required python modules --> 'pip3 install openai flask' (Flask if using api server)
4. Done.

Currently a terrible tool, but does open an idea on generating email content for brands.

Future goals with project.

1. Create workflow with interacting with gpt model. Fine tune HTML Template content produced.
2. Input discovery data from brands.
3. Add UI for brands to interact with.
